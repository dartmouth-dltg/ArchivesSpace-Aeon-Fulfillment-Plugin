# Dartmouth Specific Changes and Features

This version of the Aeon fulfillment plugin is customized to Dartmouth's specific needs.
It adds specific mappings for remote locations, modifies restrictions mappings, and 
handles single mss without location data. It also integrates with the component report
cart mechanism in the staff UI and adds the ability to create bulk requests from items
added to the cart.

## Notes

Everything in `/frontend` is Dartmouth specific. See commit history for specifics
